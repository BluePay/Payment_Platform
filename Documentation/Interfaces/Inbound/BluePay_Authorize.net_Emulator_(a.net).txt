To use BluePay's A.Net emulator, you must:

1) Replace the URL
https://secure.authorize.net/gateway/transact.dll
with
https://secure.bluepay.com/gateway/transact.dll
or
https://secure.bluepay.com/interfaces/a.net

2) Input your 12-digit BluePay ACCOUNT ID where the A.Net username
(x_Login) would normally go.

3) Input your 32-character BluePay SECRET KEY where the A.Net key or password (x_tran_key or x_password) would normally go.  In some cases your system may only accept 16 digits in this field; in that case use the first 16 characters of the SECRET KEY.


To find your ACCOUNT ID and SECRET KEY:

1) Log into the BluePay 2.0 gateway.
2) From the Administration menu, choose Accounts, and then List. 
3) On the Account List, under Options on the right-hand side, choose the first icon to view the account.  It looks like a pair of eyes.
4) On the Account Admin page, you will find the ACCOUNT ID is the second item in the right-hand column and the SECRET KEY is about halfway down the page, near a large red warning.


Test Transactions
Setting the field x_test_request to TRUE or using the URL https://secure.bluepay.com/interfaces/a.net.test will cause a transaction to be treated as a test transaction. The results of a test transaction are determined by the dollar amount of the transaction without cents. If the dollar amount is odd an approval is returned. If the dollar amount is even a decline is returned.
