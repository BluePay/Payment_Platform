# BlueView 2.0 "Merchant Daily Report 2" Interface

Last Update: 2014-01-14

# Description

This interface is intended to be polled by a merchant on a daily basis, to get
updates for transactions run on the day prior.

The URL of this interface is currently:
https://merchant.bluepay.com/interfaces/bvdailyreport2

# Input format

Input to this web service is formatted as a standard HTTP "POST" is formatted. 
The parameters to the service may be URI-encoded in the body of the request,
as is standard for a POST. 

# Output format

Output will be in the immediate response to the POST, in standard HTTP response
format with a header and a body separated by a newline.  The header contains 
and HTTP status line which will indicate a status of 200 for success and 400
for an error or other failure.  If successful, the body of the response will 
contain a number of lines, one for each updated transaction.  Each line contains
a comma-separated list of values you may use to tie the transaction back to 
data in your own system.  If failed, the output will contain only a single line,
containing a message indicating the reason for failure.

  2) Calculate the md5 of the string created in step 1.
  3) Convert the md5 to hexadecimal encoding, if necessary.  At this point it should
