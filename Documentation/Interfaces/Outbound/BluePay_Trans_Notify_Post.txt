# BluePay 2.0 Trans Notify POST

# Last Update: 2014-02-14

# Description

BluePay has the capability to send a merchant a notification after a transaction has run. This is accomplished via an HTTP POST to the customer's server. The notification provides details of the transaction.  BluePay expects a response of '200' from the customer's server; if a response of other than 200 is received the POST is assumed to have failed on the customer's end, and may be retried.

# Format

Within the body of that POST are uri-encoded name=value pairs containing the field names and values listed below. 

# Output

BP_STAMP
  Length 32
  This is an md5 hash of certain parameters in the POST so that the merchant can verify it came from BluePay and
  has not been altered in transmission or forged.  It is calculated as a concatenation of the following items:
  THE MERCHANT'S SECRET KEY + trans_id + trans_status + trans_type + amount +
  batch_id + batch_status + total_count + total_amount +
  bupload_id + rebill_id + reb_amount + status

  Absent fields are concatenated as though they contained a null string: ''.  This is similar to how the
  TAMPER_PROOF_SEAL is handled on inbound APIs, consulting the documentation for those may provide additional insight.
