BluePay Rebilling Notification System
Version 1.0
2012-12-20

###########################
Introduction

This system is intended to provide automatic notification to the merchant when a 
rebilling is run.  This is done by means of an HTTP POST to a merchant-supplied 
CGI.

###########################
Set Up

Within the online administration system, choose "Account List" from the menu.  
Then find your account, and choose the "view" (eyes) icon.  On this page, you 
can choose the "edit" (pencil) icon to enter edit mode.  Supply the URL of your 
cgi where "Rebilling POST URL" is indicated.

Thereafter, when the BluePay system runs a rebilling for you, it will POST the 
following parameters to the indicated URL:

account_id
  Gateway account ID that the transaction was processed on.

account_name
  The gateway account name.

bluepay_blurb
  Message displayed at the bottom of email receipts.

BP_STAMP
BP_STAMP_DEF
    BP_STAMP is an MD5 of the merchant's SECRET KEY, concatenated to the values 
of various fields returned from BluePay.  The exact fields and their order is 
determined by BP_STAMP_DEF.  A merchant should properly split BP_STAMP_DEF on 
whitespace, then take their SECRET KEY, and loop through the field names in the 
split BP_STAMP_DEF, concatenating each one's value to the end of the 
SECRET_KEY and previous fields.  If a field is absent from the post, 
concatenate nothing (the null string) for its value. Finally, take the MD5 of 
the resulting string, and compare it to the value of BP_STAMP.  If they match, 
the response is genuine.  If they do not, the response has been tampered with.

other values may effect further processing of the rebilling.
