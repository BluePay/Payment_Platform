# Advice on handling messages:

  Suggestion for coding is to check the status code on the transaction first; if it indicates approval, then present Approval to the customer.  If it indicates a decline or error, then drop into parsing the subset of messages that you reasonably expect.  If you fail to match the message in your table, then provide the customer with a generic message.  The vast majority of the messages below indicate some kind of coding or logic error that you will not encounter in production.
